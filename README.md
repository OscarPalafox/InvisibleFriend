# InvisibleFriend

GUI to send send an email (only tested with GMAIL) to the participants of an invisible friend group so they don't forget who 
they got. It works with groups of smaller people where people in the smaller groups don't want to gift each other.
This GUI makes people get someone different from the previous year.

3. Modify the `credentials.txt` file with the password of the gmail account that will be sending the emails
4. Run the `gui_buttons.py` file with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), the GUI will appear in a new window
