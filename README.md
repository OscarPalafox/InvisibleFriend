# InvisibleFriend

GUI to send send an email (only tested with GMAIL) to the participants of an invisible friend group so they don't forget who 
they got. It works with smaller groups where in the smaller groups you don't want to have people gifting each other.
This GUI makes people get someone different from the previous year.

To make it work, modify the SendEmail.py file to fill the gmail_user and the gmail_password.
Then in the SelecPeople.py file, change line 39 to line 53. Replace the members in each Family to put the ones you want. The 
different families allow to have different groups; basically two members in the same family will never gift each other. Fill
Big_Family with the different families and run "GUI buttons.py" to see the GUI.
